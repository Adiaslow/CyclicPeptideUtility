# Peptide Library Utility
## Synopsis
This python program was created to stream line the process of creating with linear and cyclic peptide libraries in silico and evaluating some basic cheminformatic values.

### Features
- Create a single peptide using a text-based user inteface. (Outputs cheminformatic data and SMILES string)
- Create a peptide library conbinatorially by inputing a .csv file and following a shortened text-based user inteface. (Writes cheminformatic data and SMILES string to .csv in the output folder.)
- Get basic cheminformatic data from a SMILES string.

## Installation
Below are the required libraries.
```
pip install itertools
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install rdkit
```
